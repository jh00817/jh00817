### It continues now...

## My goal

I want to be a ‘creator’ to represent Robotics of Korea.
I will be engineer leading the project with full stack.
I have been looking forward to making disaster relief robots since I was 8 years old.

I'm interested in every branch.
I want to add sensitivity to the ability of engineering students.
It is most important for robots to perform their functions, but I think the appearance should also be beautiful.
